This is the ellipsoidal incidence angle map for the reference granule from a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. Cell values indicate the incidence angle in radians based on the WGS84 ellipsoid model. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

The incidence angle map is generated by GAMMA's gc_map2 program, using metadata from the reference scene.

This product was generated using the [Copernicus DEM GLO-30](https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/fr/dataset-details?articleId=394198) to calculate the incidence angle values. The DEM is downsampled to twice the pixel spacing of the output product ({{ pixel_spacing|int }} m) in preparation for use in InSAR processing, and the incidence angle map is generated from that downsampled DEM. It is then oversampled by a factor of two to match the pixel spacing of the output InSAR product. Refer to the product README file for more information about the DEM.
