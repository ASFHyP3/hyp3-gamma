This is the ellipsoidal incidence angle map for the reference granule from a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. Cell values indicate the incidence angle in radians based on the WGS84 ellipsoid model. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

The incidence angle map is generated by GAMMA's gc_map2 program, using metadata from the reference scene.

For a detailed description of InSAR processing using GAMMA software, refer to the readme file included with the product package.
