This is the theta look vector map for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The pixel values indicate the SAR look vector elevation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi/2 (down) to pi/2 (up). It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is the theta look vector map for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The look vector elevation angle is defined as the angle between the horizontal surface and the look vector (pointing back towards the sensor), with positive angles indicating sensor positions above the surface. The pixel values indicate the SAR look vector elevation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi/2 (down) to pi/2 (up), expressed in radians. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reference Scene: {{ reference_granule_name }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Secondary Scene: {{ secondary_granule_name }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Processing Date/Time: {{ processing_date.isoformat(timespec='seconds') }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An important use of look vectors expressed in map geometry is the interpretation of 3D surface deformation. The main application is monitoring landslides and glaciers, where there is the assumption of motion along the gradient of the topographic height. Differential interferometry permits the deformation component in the SAR look direction to be estimated using the displacement component in the look direction and the direction angles (elevation theta and orientation phi) in the map geometry. The GAMMA program dispmap_vec can be used to perform these estimations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This raster can also be used to calculate an incidence angle that accounts for elevation differences but not slope angle, by subtracting the lv_theta value from pi divided by 2. This calculation is often used when applying an atmospheric correction. It is also used when recalculating vertical displacement values from an unwrapped phase raster adjusted to a new reference point.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Refer to ASF's &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;InSAR Product Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for more information about On Demand InSAR products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Sentinel-1 mission is designed to have two satellites in orbit, each with a 12-day repeat cycle. The satellites use the same orbit pattern, but are offset by 180 degrees, allowing for repeat passes every 6 days. The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. The Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. Sentinel-1C was launched December 5, 2024 to take the place of Sentinel-1B in the constellation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Between the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B and the start of the Sentinel-1C mission, all acquisitions were made by Sentinel-1A. The acquisition plan was adjusted to provide as much coverage as possible with a single satellite, but some areas had little to no imagery acquired between December 2021 and April 2025.
