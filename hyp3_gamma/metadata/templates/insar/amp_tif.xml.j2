This is the amplitude image for the reference granule from a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The pixel values indicate the calibrated radiometric backscatter in sigma-nought power. The image is terrain corrected using a geometric correction, but is not radiometrically corrected. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m. It was processed from the SLC using {{ num_looks }} looks ({{ num_looks_range }} looks in the range direction and {{ num_looks_azimuth }} looks in the azimuth direction).

The amplitude map is generated by GAMMA's multi_S1_TOPS program (called from the SLC_copy_S1_fullSW program), the output of which is a mosaicked multilook intensity (MLI) image. This is called immediately prior to interferogram creation.

For a detailed description of InSAR processing using GAMMA software, refer to the readme file included with the product package.
