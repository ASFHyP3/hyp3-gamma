This is the amplitude image for the reference granule from a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The pixel values indicate the calibrated radiometric backscatter in sigma-nought power. The image is terrain corrected using a geometric correction, but is not radiometrically corrected. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m. It was processed from the SLC using {{ num_looks }} looks ({{ num_looks_range }} looks in the range direction and {{ num_looks_azimuth }} looks in the azimuth direction).

The amplitude map is generated by GAMMA's multi_S1_TOPS program (called from the SLC_copy_S1_fullSW program), the output of which is a mosaicked multilook intensity (MLI) image. This is called immediately prior to interferogram creation.

For a detailed description of InSAR processing using GAMMA software, refer to the readme file included with the product package.

The amplitude, or backscatter intensity, indicates how much of the sent signal returns to the sensor. This amplitude product has been terrain corrected, but not radiometrically corrected, and indicates the backscatter of the reference granule only. To compare amplitude between the granules used in this interferogram, consider ordering On Demand Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products for the two images used in the InSAR pair.

Because of the range of values present in power scale amplitude datasets, the amplitude image may appear very dark when first displayed.
