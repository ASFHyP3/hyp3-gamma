Each fringe (one cycle through the color ramp) indicates line-of-sight displacement equivalent to half the sensor wavelength. The Sentinel-1 SAR sensor has a wavelength of 5.6 cm, so each fringe would represent a line-of-sight displacement of 2.8 cm. Fringes that are very close together indicate greater amounts of deformation than wider fringes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A Goldstein-Werner adaptive phase filter with a parameter (ùõº) value of 0.6 is applied by default. This filter improves fringe visibility and reduces phase noise in interferograms, particularly for InSAR pairs with low coherence. Users have the option to adjust this parameter to any value between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that no filtering occurs, and 1 indicating the strongest level of filtering. The value should generally be greater than 0.2, and interferograms with very low coherence will benefit from higher values (closer to 1). Setting this value to 0 will result in no filter being applied. This product had an adf parameter value of {{ phase_filter_parameter }} applied.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Goldstein-Werner phase filter is applied adaptively, meaning that regions with high coherence (where fringe patterns are easily discernible) will have more smoothing applied, while regions with low coherence will undergo less smoothing, so as not to remove residues that may represent actual deformation signals. Using this filter approach allows more of the interferogram to be unwrapped. For more information, refer to Goldstein and Werner's 1998 paper &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://doi.org/10.1029/1998GL900033" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Radar interferogram filtering for geophysical applications&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A browse image, tagged with color_phase.png, is also included in the product package. It is a resampled medium-resolution version of this dataset with the backscatter intensity incorporated in the background to give topographic context to the displacement. The fringes have a pre-set color ramp applied, which can make them easier to count than in a black-and-white rendering, but the amplitude background and lower resolution of the browse can make fringes difficult to distinguish in areas of high deformation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No atmospheric corrections have been applied to this interferogram. Use caution when looking at a single interferogram, as atmospheric effects can easily be misinterpreted as surface deformation. While SAR signals can penetrate clouds, atmospheric conditions can delay the transmission of the signal. This results in phase differences that can look like surface deformation signals, but are actually driven by differences in the atmospheric conditions between the pair of acquisitions used to generate the interferogram. Consider applying an atmospheric model to correct for atmospheric delay, or examining other InSAR pairs that bracket the same event but were acquired on different dates to determine if atmospheric effects are driving the phase differences.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To view this GeoTIFF in ArcGIS with a color ramp similar to the one applied to the browse, open the symbology properties for the layer (or click on the color ramp in the TOC) and apply a color ramp that utilizes a wide range of the spectrum. For ArcGIS Pro, the Bathymetry color ramp in inverse order most closely replicates the GAMMA color ramp, but the Spectral (Continuous) color ramp also works well. In ArcMap, the Spectrum-Full Bright color ramp works well.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Refer to ASF's &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;InSAR Product Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for more information about On Demand InSAR products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Sentinel-1 mission is designed to be a two-satellite constellation. Sentinel-1A was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. Sentinel-1B was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle and use the same orbit pattern, but are offset 180 degrees to allow repeat passes every 6 days while both are active.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Since the mission ended for S1B, there are some significant gaps in coverage. A reduced acquisition plan will be in place until Sentinel-1C is launched (expected in 2023) to replace Sentinel-1B.

The wrapped phase interferogram is generated prior to the phase unwrapping step (step 8) during InSAR processing.

The basic steps in InSAR processing are as follows:

*Pre-Processing*
1. Ingest SLC data into GAMMA format
2. Get DEM file covering the area, apply geoid correction and resample/reproject as required
3. Calculate overlapping bursts for input scenes
4. Mosaic swaths and bursts together

*InSAR Processing*
5. Prepare initial look-up table and simulated unwrapped image
    - Derive lookup table for SLC/MLI co-registration (considering terrain heights)
    - Simulate unwrapped interferometric phase using DEM height, and deformation rate using orbit state vectors
6. Interferogram creation, matching, refinement
    - Initial co-registration with look-up table
    - Iterative co-registration with look-up table
    - Removal of curved earth and topographic phase
7. Determine a co-registration offset based on the burst overlap (spectral diversity method)
    - Single iteration co-registration with look-up table
8. Phase unwrapping and coherence map generation
9. Generation of displacement maps from unwrapped differential phase

*Post-Processing*
10. Generation of geocoded GeoTIFF outputs
