The coherence map is generated as part of the phase unwrapping workflow (step 8), using GAMMA's cc_wave program.

The basic steps in InSAR processing are as follows:

*Pre-Processing*
1. Ingest SLC data into GAMMA format
2. Get DEM file covering the area, apply geoid correction and resample/reproject as required
3. Calculate overlapping bursts for input scenes
4. Mosaic swaths and bursts together

*InSAR Processing*
5. Prepare initial look-up table and simulated unwrapped image
    - Derive lookup table for SLC/MLI co-registration (considering terrain heights)
    - Simulate unwrapped interferometric phase using DEM height, and deformation rate using orbit state vectors
6. Interferogram creation, matching, refinement
    - Initial co-registration with look-up table
    - Iterative co-registration with look-up table
    - Removal of curved earth and topographic phase
7. Determine a co-registration offset based on the burst overlap (spectral diversity method)
    - Single iteration co-registration with look-up table
8. Phase unwrapping and coherence map generation
9. Generation of displacement maps from unwrapped differential phase

*Post-Processing*
10. Generation of geocoded GeoTIFF outputs

The spectra of the two images used for InSAR must overlap well enough to generate interferometric fringes. Areas without common overlap must be filtered out prior to InSAR generation. The correlation indicates the accuracy of the phase information, or the visibility of fringes. Areas with low correlation will have noisier phase. The magnitude of the correlation is commonly referred to as coherence. The coherence map is output as a GeoTIFF with values ranging from 0 to 1; the larger the number, the higher the coherence (and the better the correlation). The values are generated using a sliding window approach, which integrates surrounding information into the calculation of the pixel value while placing a higher weight on the values near the center of the window to reduce loss of resolution.

The coherence map can sometimes be useful as a change detection tool. Decorrelation is caused by changes in the location and orientation of scatterers on the surface of the earth in the time between image acquisitions, and areas with low coherence generally have undergone some sort of change. By looking for low coherence values, you may be able to identify where changes have occurred on the landscape.

Vegetated areas often display very low coherence from one acquisition to the next, as plants grow and change in structure, and even different wind conditions on the acquisition dates can contribute to decorrelation. High levels of crustal deformation can also result in incoherence, which can cause problems when InSAR is being used to measure deformation. If the coherence is too low, the data will not be used when generating interferograms.

Sensors with longer wavelengths will be more robust to decorrelation, so it may be necessary to use data from an L-band sensor when analyzing cases of extreme deformation or where vegetation significantly impacts coherence at shorter wavelengths.
