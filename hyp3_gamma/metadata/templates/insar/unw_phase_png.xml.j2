This PNG file is a browse image of the unwrapped interferogram for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. [ADD DESCRIPTION OF COLOR RAMP; is it 160m per color cycle? pg 70 user guide. But that seems to be for elevation mapping, not unwrapped values] [ADD DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND. Intensity? Looks more like hillshade.] The image is resampled from the wrapped interferogram to be 2048 pixels wide.

This is the unwrapped interferogram for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The process of unwrapping the wrapped interferogram applies an integer multiple of the 2-pi values sequentially to adjacent fringes, generating the absolute phase difference across the image. The file is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }} with a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

The unwrapped interferogram uses a reference point to convert the wrapped 2-pi scale into a continuous scale into a continuous scale (of multiples of pi), and is the most important and complicated step in InSAR processing. It relies on having a reference point beyond the area of deformation, and is most effective when there are not any areas with deformation greater than half the sensor wavelength within the space of a single fringe. In regions of large-magnitude deformations or extremely steep topography, the fringes may be too close together to resolve, or one fringe may actually represent a jump of multiple phase wraps. GAMMA software uses algorithms to detect phase inconsistencies and treat them appropriately, but some deformations may still be too large to generate reliable data.

The GeoTIFF contains the unwrapped phase difference values for each pixel, which corresponds to the change in distance along the line of sight of the sensor. Positive values indicate movement away from the sensor (caused by subsidence or lateral movement away from the sensor) and negative values indicate movement towards the sensor (uplift or lateral movement towards the sensor). Note that deformation often includes both vertical and horizontal components, and additional processing or external reference data is required to calculate the relative contributions of vertical and lateral movement from the line-of-sight phase changes.

The displacement maps included in the product package display values that have been converted from phase difference to reflect the magnitude of the deformation in meters. Note that the values of the displacement maps are presented from the opposite perspective of the phase difference in the unwrapped interferogram. While movement towards the sensor will have negative values in the unwrapped interferogram, this direction of movement will be translated into positive values in the displacement maps. The signal path becomes shorter in the case of uplift, as the surface is closer to the sensor than previously (negative change in phase), but negative values for uplift would be counterintuitive in a displacement map, which is describing the movement relative to the surface of the earth rather than relative to the sensor location.

This GeoTIFF is displayed in grayscale by default, but it may be helpful to apply a color ramp to better illustrate the direction of phase change. To apply a color ramp to the image in ArcGIS, open the symbology properties for the layer (or click on the color ramp in the TOC) and apply a color ramp that displays two very different colors such as red and blue at the extremities with a neutral color in between. The Prediction color ramp is available in both ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap. Other good ramps include Red-Yellow-Blue (Continuous) or Red-Blue (Continuous) in ArcGIS Pro, and Cold to Hot Diverging or Red to Blue Diverging in ArcMap.
