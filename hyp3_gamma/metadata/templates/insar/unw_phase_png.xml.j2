This PNG file is a browse image of the unwrapped interferogram for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. [ADD DESCRIPTION OF COLOR RAMP; is it 160m per color cycle? pg 70 user guide. But that seems to be for elevation mapping, not unwrapped values] [ADD DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND. Intensity? Looks more like hillshade.] The image is resampled from the wrapped interferogram to be 2048 pixels wide.

The unwrapped interferogram uses a reference point to convert the wrapped 2-pi scale into a continuous scale into a continuous scale (of multiples of pi), and is the most important and complicated step in InSAR processing. It relies on having a reference point beyond the area of deformation, and is most effective when there are not any areas with deformation greater than half the sensor wavelength within the space of a single fringe. In regions of large-magnitude deformations or extremely steep topography, the fringes may be too close together to resolve, or one fringe may actually represent a jump of multiple phase wraps. GAMMA software uses algorithms to detect phase inconsistencies and treat them appropriately, but some deformations may still be too large to generate reliable data.
