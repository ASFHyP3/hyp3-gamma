This PNG file is a browse image of the unwrapped interferogram for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The color fringes indicate phase differences of 6-pi over the extent of one color cycle. The unwrapped phase data is underlain with backscatter intensity (amplitude) data to place the phase differences in topographic context. The image is resampled from the unwrapped interferogram to be 2048 pixels wide.

&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This PNG file is a browse image of the unwrapped interferogram for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The process of unwrapping the wrapped interferogram applies an integer multiple of the 2-pi values sequentially to adjacent fringes, generating the relative phase difference between the two acquisitions across the image. The color fringes indicate phase differences of 6-pi over the extent of one color cycle, which equate to 3 times the sensor wavelength in line-of-sight displacement. The unwrapped phase data is underlain with backscatter intensity (amplitude) data to place the phase differences in topographic context. The image is resampled from the unwrapped interferogram to be 2048 pixels wide.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reference Scene: {{ reference_granule_name }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Secondary Scene: {{ secondary_granule_name }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Processing Date/Time: {{ processing_date.isoformat(timespec='seconds') }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The unwrapped interferogram uses a reference point to convert the wrapped 2-pi scale into a continuous scale (of multiples of 2-pi), and is the most important and complicated step in InSAR processing. The unwrapped phase GeoTIFF contains the actual values; this is simply a low-resolution browse image with a cyclical color ramp applied to indicate phase movement in a way that displays where phase differences are greatest. While GAMMA software uses algorithms to detect phase inconsistencies and treat them appropriately, it is important to be aware that phase unwrapping errors can and do occur. Time series analysis may be helpful for identifying and correcting such errors.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This browse image is also provided as a KMZ file for use in Google Earth or other platforms that read KMZ format. In addition, a full-resolution GeoTIFF of the unwrapped interferogram is included, which contains the unwrapped phase difference values for each pixel. These values correspond to the change in distance along the line of sight of the sensor, with positive values indicating movement away from the sensor (caused by subsidence or lateral movement away from the sensor) and negative values indicating movement towards the sensor (uplift or lateral movement towards the sensor). Note that deformation often includes both vertical and horizontal components, and additional processing or external reference data is required to calculate the relative contributions of vertical and lateral movement from the line-of-sight phase changes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The displacement maps included in the product package display values that have been converted from phase difference to reflect the magnitude of the deformation in meters. Note that the values of the displacement maps are presented from the opposite perspective of the phase difference in the unwrapped interferogram. While areas with movement towards the sensor will have negative values in the unwrapped interferogram, this direction of movement will be translated into positive values in the displacement maps. The signal path becomes shorter in the case of uplift, as the surface is closer to the sensor than previously (negative change in phase), but negative values for uplift would be counterintuitive in a displacement map, which is describing the movement relative to the surface of the earth rather than relative to the sensor location.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No atmospheric corrections have been applied to the interferogram used to generate this browse image. Use caution when looking at a single interferogram, as atmospheric effects can easily be misinterpreted as surface deformation. While SAR signals can penetrate clouds, atmospheric conditions can delay the transmission of the signal. This results in phase differences that can look like surface deformation signals, but are actually driven by differences in the atmospheric conditions between the pair of acquisitions used to generate the interferogram.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Refer to ASF's &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;InSAR Product Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for more information about On Demand InSAR products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and the Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016.
