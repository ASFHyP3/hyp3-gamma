The vertical displacement map is generated by scaling the unwrapped phase values (step 9) using GAMMA's dispmap program.

The basic steps in InSAR processing are as follows:

*Pre-Processing*
1. Ingest SLC data into GAMMA format
2. Get DEM file covering the area, apply geoid correction and resample/reproject as required
3. Calculate overlapping bursts for input scenes
4. Mosaic swaths and bursts together

*InSAR Processing*
5. Prepare initial look-up table and simulated unwrapped image
    - Derive lookup table for SLC/MLI co-registration (considering terrain heights)
    - Simulate unwrapped interferometric phase using DEM height, and deformation rate using orbit state vectors
6. Interferogram creation, matching, refinement
    - Initial co-registration with look-up table
    - Iterative co-registration with look-up table
    - Removal of curved earth and topographic phase
7. Determine a co-registration offset based on the burst overlap (spectral diversity method)
    - Single iteration co-registration with look-up table
8. Phase unwrapping and coherence map generation
9. Generation of displacement maps from unwrapped differential phase

*Post-Processing*
10. Generation of geocoded GeoTIFF outputs

For a detailed description of InSAR processing using GAMMA software, refer to the readme file included with the product package.

The vertical displacement map converts the unwrapped differential phase into measurements of vertical ground movement in meters, assuming that there is no horizontal component to the displacement.
