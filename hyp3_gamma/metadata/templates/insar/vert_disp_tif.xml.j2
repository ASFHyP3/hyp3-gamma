Positive values indicate uplift, while negative values indicate subsidence. It is important to be aware that many deformation processes have both vertical and horizontal components, and it is not possible to determine the relative contribution of each from a single interferogram alone. Time series analysis or external data sources such as GNSS measurements may be necessary to generate reliable displacement maps that take into consideration the relative influences of horizontal and vertical movement.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The displacement values are calculated relative to the phase unwrapping reference point, which is set to be the location of the pixel with the highest coherence value. Ideally the reference point would be in an area of high coherence beyond where deformation has occurred, but because it is assigned by default, it may not be optimal. If you are interested in the amount of displacement in a particular area, you may wish to apply a correction to the image so that the range of values are more appropriate for your study area or application.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To adjust the vertical displacement values so that they are relative to a new reference point, you will need to apply a correction to the unwrapped phase raster first, and then recalculate the vertical displacement values from that. The process requires the elevation look vector raster (lv_theta), which is not included in the InSAR product package by default. To include the look vector rasters in the product package, select the "Include Look Vectors" option when submitting an InSAR On Demand job. For guidance on how to calculate an adjusted vertical displacement map, refer to the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/#phase-unwrapping-reference-point" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Phase Unwrapping Reference Point section in the InSAR Product Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Displacement maps are also impacted by the errors that can be present in the unwrapped phase, including atmospheric effects and phase unwrapping errors. Consider applying an atmospheric correction or using time series analysis to mitigate the impacts of these errors. A potential source of phase unwrapping error is when expanses of water meet the criteria for pixels valid for phase unwrapping, leading to unexpected phase jumps (refer to the documentation for the unwrapped phase GeoTIFF for more information).

While movement towards the sensor will have negative values in the unwrapped interferogram, this direction of movement will be translated into positive values in the displacement maps. The signal path becomes shorter in the case of uplift, as the surface is closer to the sensor than previously (negative change in phase), but negative values for uplift would be counterintuitive in a displacement map, which is describing the movement relative to the surface of the earth rather than relative to the sensor location.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This GeoTIFF is displayed in grayscale by default, but it may be helpful to apply a color ramp to better illustrate the direction of phase change. To apply a color ramp to the image in ArcGIS, open the symbology properties for the layer (or click on the color ramp in the TOC) and apply a color ramp that displays two very different colors such as red and blue at the extremities with a neutral color in between. The Prediction color ramp is available in both ArcGIS Pro and ArcMap.

The satellites use the same orbit pattern, but are offset by 180 degrees, allowing for repeat passes every 6 days. The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. The Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. Sentinel-1C was launched December 5, 2024 to take the place of Sentinel-1B in the constellation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Between the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B and the start of the Sentinel-1C mission, all acquisitions were made by Sentinel-1A. The acquisition plan was adjusted to provide as much coverage as possible with a single satellite, but some areas had little to no imagery acquired between December 2021 and April 2025.

The vertical displacement map is generated by scaling the unwrapped phase values (step 9) using GAMMA's dispmap program.

The basic steps in InSAR processing are as follows:

*Pre-Processing*
1. Ingest SLC data into GAMMA format
2. Get DEM file covering the area, apply geoid correction and resample/reproject as required
3. Calculate overlapping bursts for input scenes
4. Mosaic swaths and bursts together

*InSAR Processing*
5. Prepare initial look-up table and simulated unwrapped image
    - Derive lookup table for SLC/MLI co-registration (considering terrain heights)
    - Simulate unwrapped interferometric phase using DEM height, and deformation rate using orbit state vectors
6. Interferogram creation, matching, refinement
    - Initial co-registration with look-up table
    - Iterative co-registration with look-up table
    - Removal of curved earth and topographic phase
7. Determine a co-registration offset based on the burst overlap (spectral diversity method)
    - Single iteration co-registration with look-up table
8. Phase unwrapping and coherence map generation
9. Generation of displacement maps from unwrapped differential phase

*Post-Processing*
10. Generation of geocoded GeoTIFF outputs

For a detailed description of InSAR processing using GAMMA software, refer to the readme file included with the product package.

The vertical displacement map converts the unwrapped differential phase into measurements of vertical ground movement in meters, assuming that there is no horizontal component to the displacement. Positive values indicate uplift, while negative values indicate subsidence. It is important to be aware that many deformation processes have both vertical and horizontal components, and it is not possible to determine the relative contribution of each from a single interferogram alone. Time series analysis or external data sources such as GNSS measurements may be necessary to generate reliable displacement maps that take into consideration the relative influences of horizontal and vertical movement.

The displacement values are calculated relative to the phase unwrapping reference point, which is set to be the location of the pixel with the highest coherence value. Ideally the reference point would be in an area of high coherence beyond where deformation has occurred, but because it is assigned by default, it may not be optimal. If you are interested in the amount of displacement in a particular area, you may wish to apply a correction to the image so that the range of values are more appropriate for your study area or application.

To adjust the vertical displacement values so that they are relative to a new reference point, you will need to apply a correction to the unwrapped phase raster first, and then recalculate the vertical displacement values from that.

For guidance on how to calculate an adjusted vertical displacement map, refer to the [Phase Unwrapping Reference Point section in the InSAR Product Guide](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/#phase-unwrapping-reference-point).

Displacement maps are also impacted by the errors that can be present in the unwrapped phase, including atmospheric effects and phase unwrapping errors. Consider applying an atmospheric correction or using time series analysis to mitigate the impacts of these errors. A potential source of phase unwrapping error is when expanses of water meet the criteria for pixels valid for phase unwrapping, leading to unexpected phase jumps (refer to the documentation for the unwrapped phase GeoTIFF for more information).

Note that the values of the displacement maps are presented from the opposite perspective of the phase difference in the unwrapped interferogram.

The signal path becomes shorter in the case of uplift, as the surface is closer to the sensor than previously (negative change in phase), but negative values for uplift would be counterintuitive in a displacement map, which is describing the movement relative to the surface of the earth rather than relative to the sensor location.
