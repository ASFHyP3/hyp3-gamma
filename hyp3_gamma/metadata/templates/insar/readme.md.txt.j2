### Pixel Spacing ###

When ordering InSAR On Demand products, users can choose between 20x4 looks or 10x2 looks, which drives the resolution and pixel spacing of the output products. The first number indicates the number of looks in range, the second is the number of looks in azimuth.

The output product pixel spacing depends on the number of looks in azimuth:
pixel spacing = 20 * azimuth looks

Products with 20x4 looks have a pixel spacing of 80 m, while those with 10x2 looks have a pixel spacing of 40 m.

Interferometric SAR (InSAR) uses the phase differences from repeat passes over the same area to identify regions where the distance between the sensor and the earth's surface has changed. This allows for the detection and quantification of deformation or movement.

Note that the imaging surface will vary depending on the sensor wavelength. Because Sentinel-1 is a C-band sensor, the waves will not penetrate very deeply into vegetation. The imagery likely represents the top of the canopy in densely vegetated areas rather than the actual terrain. In addition, vegetated areas tend to have low coherence, because plants can grow or move from one acquisition to the next. Use caution when generating interferograms for areas with extensive/dense vegetation cover.

A digital elevation model is required for processing InSAR. The DEM used for this particular product is the Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM, which has a native resolution of 1 arc second (about 30 meters). This DEM is a global Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from the WorldDEM. The WorldDEM is based on radar satellite data acquired by the TanDEM-X mission, which was funded by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Airbus Defence and Space, and edited to flatten water bodies, provide consistent flow of rivers, and apply corrections to shore/coastlines and special features.

*See below for detailed descriptions of each of the product files.*

----------------
## 1. Wrapped Interferogram

The wrapped interferogram is output in both a georeferenced PNG and KMZ format by default, and the full GeoTIFF file can also be optionally included. Because the fringes are on a wrapped 2-pi scale rather than representing continuous phase difference values, a wrapped interferogram tends to be most useful as a color visualization. This product displays deformation in multiples of half of the sensor wavelength, so areas with fringes that are very close together indicate greater amounts of deformation in the line-of-sight direction from the sensor.

The wrapped interferogram image is generated from the interferogram phase prior to unwrapping. The PNG and KMZ files are tagged with _color_phase, and are 2048 pixels wide. The optional GeoTIFF is tagged with _wrapped_phase.tif

*The GeoTIFF version of the wrapped interferogram is optional. Select the "Include Wrapped Phase" option in the On Demand HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

----------------
## 2. Unwrapped Interferogram

The unwrapped interferogram uses a reference point to convert the wrapped 2-pi scale into a continuous scale (of multiples of pi), and is the most important and complicated step in InSAR processing. The Minimum Cost Flow (MCF) approach was used for phase unwrapping this product, and the reference point was set to the top left corner of the image.

The GeoTIFF contains the unwrapped phase difference values for each pixel, corresponding to the change in distance along the line of sight of the sensor. Positive values indicate movement away from the sensor (caused by subsidence or lateral movement away from the sensor) and negative values indicate movement towards the sensor (uplift or lateral movement towards the sensor). Note that deformation often includes both vertical and horizontal components, and additional processing or external reference data is required to calculate the relative contributions of vertical and lateral movement.

Phase unwrapping is most effective when the reference point is beyond the area of deformation and there are not any areas with deformation greater than half the sensor wavelength within the space of a single fringe. In regions of large-magnitude deformations or extremely steep topography, the fringes may be too close together to resolve, or one fringe may actually represent a jump of multiple phase wraps. GAMMA software uses algorithms to detect phase inconsistencies and treat them appropriately, but some deformations may still be too large to generate reliable data.

It is important to be aware that phase unwrapping errors can and do occur. In addition, no atmospheric correction has been applied to this interferogram. While SAR signals can penetrate clouds, atmospheric conditions can delay the transmission of the signal, resulting in phase differences between acquisition that can look like surface deformation signals. In some cases, atmospheric models can be used to remove these impacts. Time series analysis may also be helpful for identifying and correcting both unwrapping errors and atmospheric impacts.

The unwrapped interferogram files are tagged with _unw_phase, and the _unw_phase.tif file contains the data values. The PNG and KMZ files are both 2048 pixels wide.

----------------
## 3. Line-of-Sight Displacement Map

The LOS displacement map is in GeoTIFF format and converts the unwrapped differential phase into measurements of ground movement in meters along the look vector (line-of-sight). Positive values indicate movement towards the sensor (such as uplift), while negative values indicate movement away from the sensor (such as subsidence).

The LOS displacement map is tagged with _los_disp.tif

*This file is optional. Select the "Include LOS Displacement" option in the On Demand HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

----------------
## 4. Vertical Displacement Map

GAMMA software generates a vertical displacement GeoTIFF from the unwrapped differential phase measurements under the assumption that the displacement is entirely in the vertical direction. The height map is transformed from the radar geometry (slant range/Doppler) using a DEM and resampled to the WGS84 ellipsoid to output an orthorectified product.

Note that in cases where displacement has both a vertical and a horizontal component to the change, the assumptions used to generate height may not be correct. Time series analysis or external data sources may be necessary to generate reliable displacement maps that take into consideration the relative influences of horizontal and vertical movement.

Values are in meters, with positive values indicating uplift and negative values indicating subsidence.

The vertical displacement map is tagged with _vert_disp.tif

----------------
## 5. Coherence Map

The spectra of the two images used for InSAR must overlap well enough to generate interferometric fringes. Areas without common overlap must be filtered out prior to InSAR generation. The correlation indicates the accuracy of the phase information, or the visibility of fringes. Areas with low correlation will have noisier phase. The magnitude of the correlation is commonly referred to as coherence. The coherence map is output as a GeoTIFF with values ranging from 0 to 1; the larger the number, the higher the coherence (and the better the correlation).

The coherence map is tagged with _corr.tif

----------------
## 6. Amplitude Image

The amplitude GeoTIFF displays the calibrated radiometric backscatter (intensity) values of the reference granule in sigma-nought power. The image is terrain corrected using a geometric correction, but not radiometrically corrected. For more informative amplitude data, order Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products for your area of interest.

The amplitude image is tagged with _amp.tif

----------------
## 7. Parameter Documentation

The text file included with the product lists the key processing parameters used, including the full granule names, baseline length, number of looks, output resolution, and source DEM information.

The text file is not tagged; it has a .txt extension on the base filename.

----------------
## 8. Look Vector Maps

Two look vector maps are output with as GeoTIFFs. The lv_theta map indicates the SAR look vector elevation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi/2 (down) to pi/2 (up). The lv_phi map indicates the SAR look vector orientation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi/2 (south) to pi/2 (north), with east being 0. Angles are expressed in radians, referencing the look direction back towards the sensor, and are calculated from a horizontal elevation plane at each pixel.

*These files are optional. Select the "Include Look Vectors" option in the On Demand HyP3 Processing Options to include them in the product package.*

----------------
## 9. Incidence Angle Map

The local incidence angle is defined as the angle between the incident radar signal and the local surface normal (direction perpendicular to the ground surface, determined from the DEM). The output is a GeoTIFF giving the local incidence angle in radians for each pixel in the scene.

*This file is optional. Select the "Include Inc. Angle Map" option in the On Demand HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

----------------
## 10. DEM used to process the data

This is a copy of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layer used for processing. This layer is tagged with _dem.tif, and is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF.

The source DEM has a geoid correction applied before it is used for processing, so height values in this file will differ from the source DEM. The DEM is down-sampled to twice the pixel spacing of the desired InSAR output pixel spacing to smooth it before processing. As such, an 80-m InSAR product requires the DEM to be down-sampled to a pixel spacing of 160 m. It is provided in the same pixel spacing/alignment and projected to the same UTM Zone as the interferogram files.

*This file is optional. Select the "Include DEM" option in the On Demand HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

The DEM used for this product is {{ dem_name }}, which has a native pixel spacing of {{ dem_pixel_spacing(dem_name) }}. {{ dem_blurb(dem_name) }}

{% if dem_blurb(dem_name) %}
*Refer to the _dem.tif.xml file for additional information about the specific DEM included with this product, including use and citation requirements.*
