This PNG file is a browse image of the wrapped interferogram for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The fringes indicate phase difference values on a wrapped 2-pi scale, and are underlain with backscatter intensity (amplitude) data to place the phase differences in topographic context. The image is resampled from the wrapped interferogram to be 2048 pixels wide.

&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This file is a browse image of the wrapped interferogram for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The image is generated from the interferogram phase difference values prior to unwrapping, so the values are constrained to a wrapped range of 2-pi, represented by a complete cycle through the color ramp (one "fringe"). The fringes are displayed on a background of the backscatter intensity values to give topographic context to the deformation. The pixel spacing is resampled so that the output image is 2048 pixels wide.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reference Scene: {{ reference_granule_name }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Secondary Scene: {{ secondary_granule_name }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Processing Date/Time: {{ processing_date.isoformat(timespec='seconds') }}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Because the values are on a wrapped 2-pi scale rather than representing continuous phase difference values, a wrapped interferogram tends to be most useful as a color visualization. Each fringe (one cycle through the color ramp) indicates line-of-sight displacement equivalent to half the sensor wavelength. The Sentinel-1 SAR sensor has a wavelength of 5.6 cm, so each fringe would represent a line-of-sight displacement of 2.8 cm. Fringes that are very close together indicate greater amounts of deformation than wider fringes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This browse image is also provided as a KMZ file for use in Google Earth or other platforms that read KMZ format. In addition, a full-resolution GeoTIFF of the wrapped interferogram can be optionally included in the product package, though it is excluded by default. The GeoTIFF displays only the phase difference data without the amplitude background.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No atmospheric corrections have been applied to the interferogram used to generate this browse image. Use caution when looking at a single interferogram, as atmospheric effects can easily be misinterpreted as surface deformation. While SAR signals can penetrate clouds, atmospheric conditions can delay the transmission of the signal. This results in phase differences that can look like surface deformation signals, but are actually driven by differences in the atmospheric conditions between the pair of acquisitions used to generate the interferogram.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Refer to ASF's &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;InSAR Product Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for more information about On Demand InSAR products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and the Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016.
