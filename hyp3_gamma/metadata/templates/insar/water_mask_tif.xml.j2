The satellites use the same orbit pattern, but are offset by 180 degrees, allowing for repeat passes every 6 days. The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. The Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. Sentinel-1C was launched December 5, 2024 to take the place of Sentinel-1B in the constellation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Between the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B and the start of the Sentinel-1C mission, all acquisitions were made by Sentinel-1A. The acquisition plan was adjusted to provide as much coverage as possible with a single satellite, but some areas had little to no imagery acquired between December 2021 and April 2025.

The water mask is generated by ASF using data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) and/or [ESA WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en/about/about) depending on location. Areas within Canada, Alaska, and Russia are primarily covered by ESA WorldCover data, while the rest of the world is covered by OpenStreetMap data. All areas between 85 and 90 degrees north latitude are assigned a value of 0, and all areas between 85 and 90 degrees south latitude are assigned a value of 1.

One potential source of error during phase unwrapping is the presence of extensive surface water (coastal areas or large inland waterbodies). In some cases, signal returns over surface water meet the coherence and amplitude threshold criteria, even though measurements over water should not be coherent. When this happens, phase unwrapping can occur over expanses of water, leading to unexpected phase jumps over land.

The Sentinel-1 mission is designed to be a two-satellite constellation. Sentinel-1A was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. Sentinel-1B was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle and use the same orbit pattern, but are offset 180 degrees to allow repeat passes every 6 days while both are active.

Since the mission ended for S1B, there are some significant gaps in coverage. A reduced acquisition plan will be in place until Sentinel-1C is launched (expected in 2024) to replace Sentinel-1B. Visit [https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/sentinel1](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/sentinel1/) for more information.
