This is the water mask for the InSAR products generated from a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules. Values of 0 indicate water, and pixels over land have a value of 1.

In some cases, signal returns over surface water meet the coherence and amplitude threshold criteria, even though measurements over water should not be coherent. When this happens, phase unwrapping can occur over expanses of water, leading to unexpected deformation signals or phase jumps over land.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Consider selecting the "Apply Water Mask" option when processing InSAR in areas with significant surface water. This option edits the phase unwrapping validity mask so that pixels over water are given a value of 0 (not valid for phase unwrapping).

Sentinel-1A was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. Sentinel-1B was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle and use the same orbit pattern, but are offset 180 degrees to allow repeat passes every 6 days while both are active.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Since the mission ended for S1B, there are some significant gaps in coverage. A reduced acquisition plan will be in place until Sentinel-1C is launched (expected in 2023) to replace Sentinel-1B.

This is the water mask for the InSAR products generated from a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules. The mask covers coastal waters and large inland waterbodies, and was generated based on OpenStreetMaps and ESA WorldCover data. Pixels over water have a value of 0, while pixels over land have a value of 1. It has been projected to {{ projection }} coordinates, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m. This mask {{ "has" if water_mask_applied else "has not" }} been applied during phase unwrapping.

Reference Scene: {{ reference_granule_name }}
Secondary Scene: {{ secondary_granule_name }}
Processing Date/Time: {{ processing_date.isoformat(timespec='seconds') }}

The water mask is generated by the HyP3 team using data from OpenStreetMaps(https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) and/or ESA WorldCover(https://esa-worldcover.org/en/about/about) depending on location. Areas within Canada, Alaska, and Russia are primarily covered by ESA WorldCover data, while the rest of the world is covered by OpenStreetMaps data. Water masks were previously generated from the GSHHG dataset. Refer to our InSAR Water Masking Tutorial for more information: https://arcg.is/19aKHj

One potential source of error during phase unwrapping is the presence of extensive surface water (coastal areas or large inland waterbodies). In some cases, signal returns over surface water meet the coherence and amplitude threshold criteria, even though measurements over water should not be coherent. When this happens, phase unwrapping can occur over expanses of water, leading to unexpected phase jumps over land. This water mask is included as a stand-alone raster in all of ASF's InSAR products, but users can select the "Apply Water Mask" option when ordering InSAR jobs to include this water mask in the criteria for the validity mask used in phase unwrapping.

The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and the Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle. More information about the mission is available at https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1
