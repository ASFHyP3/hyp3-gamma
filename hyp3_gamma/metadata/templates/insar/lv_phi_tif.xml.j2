This is the phi look vector map for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The pixel values indicate the SAR look vector orientation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi/2 (south) to pi/2 (north), with east being 0. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.
