This is the phi look vector map for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The pixel values indicate the SAR look vector orientation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi to pi, with east being 0, north being pi/2, and south being -pi/2. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is the phi look vector map for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The look vector orientation angle is defined as the angle between the East direction and the projection of the look vector (pointing back towards the sensor) on the horizontal surface plane. The pixel values indicate the SAR look vector orientation angle at each map pixel, with values of 0 indicating east, pi/2 indicating north, and -pi/2 indicating south. The range of the orientation angle is -pi to pi, expressed in radians.

The main application is monitoring landslides and glaciers, where there is the assumption of motion along the gradient of the topographic height.

The GAMMA program dispmap_vec can be used to perform these estimations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Refer to ASF's &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;InSAR Product Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for more information about On Demand InSAR products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Sentinel-1 mission is designed to have two satellites in orbit, each with a 12-day repeat cycle. The satellites use the same orbit pattern, but are offset by 180 degrees, allowing for repeat passes every 6 days. The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. The Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. Sentinel-1C was launched December 5, 2024 to take the place of Sentinel-1B in the constellation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Between the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B and the start of the Sentinel-1C mission, all acquisitions were made by Sentinel-1A. The acquisition plan was adjusted to provide as much coverage as possible with a single satellite, but some areas had little to no imagery acquired between December 2021 and April 2025.
