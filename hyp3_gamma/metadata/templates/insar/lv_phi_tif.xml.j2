This is the phi look vector map for a pair of Sentinel-1 {{ granule_type }} granules, processed using GAMMA software. The pixel values indicate the SAR look vector orientation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi to pi, with east being 0, north being pi2, and south being -pi2. It is a 32-bit float GeoTIFF projected to {{ projection }}, and has a pixel spacing of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

The look vector orientation angle is defined as the angle between the East direction and the projection of the look vector (pointing back towards the sensor) on the horizontal surface plane.

The main application is monitoring landslides and glaciers, where there is the assumption of motion along the gradient of the topographic height. Differential interferometry permits the deformation component in the SAR look direction to be estimated using the displacement component in the look direction and the direction angles (elevation theta and orientation phi) in the map geometry. The GAMMA program dispmap_vec can be used to perform these estimations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Refer to ASF's &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/" target="_blank" &gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;InSAR Product Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for more information about On Demand InSAR products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Sentinel-1 mission is designed to be a two-satellite constellation. Sentinel-1A was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. Sentinel-1B was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle and use the same orbit pattern, but are offset 180 degrees to allow repeat passes every 6 days while both are active.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Since the mission ended for S1B, there are some significant gaps in coverage. A reduced acquisition plan will be in place until Sentinel-1C is launched (expected in 2023) to replace Sentinel-1B.
