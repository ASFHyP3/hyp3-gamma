While areas with movement towards the sensor will have negative values in the unwrapped interferogram, this direction of movement will be translated into positive values in the displacement maps. The signal path becomes shorter in the case of uplift, as the surface is closer to the sensor than previously (negative change in phase), but negative values for uplift would be counterintuitive in a displacement map, which is describing the movement relative to the surface of the earth rather than relative to the sensor location.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No atmospheric corrections have been applied to this interferogram. Use caution when looking at a single interferogram, as atmospheric effects can easily be misinterpreted as surface deformation. While SAR signals can penetrate clouds, atmospheric conditions can delay the transmission of the signal. This results in phase differences that can look like surface deformation signals, but are actually driven by differences in the atmospheric conditions between the pair of acquisitions used to generate the interferogram. Consider applying an atmospheric model to correct for atmospheric delay, or examining other InSAR pairs that bracket the same event but were acquired on different dates to determine if atmospheric effects are driving the phase differences.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This GeoTIFF is displayed in grayscale by default, but it may be helpful to apply a color ramp to better illustrate the direction of phase change. To apply a color ramp to the image in ArcGIS, open the symbology properties for the layer (or click on the color ramp in the TOC) and apply a color ramp that displays two very different colors such as red and blue at the extremities with a neutral color in between.

The unwrapped phase interferogram is generated from the wrapped interferogram during InSAR processing (step 8) using GAMMA's mcf program, which applies a Minimum Cost Flow approach for phase unwrapping.

The basic steps in InSAR processing are as follows:

*Pre-Processing*
1. Ingest SLC data into GAMMA format
2. Get DEM file covering the area, apply geoid correction and resample/reproject as required
3. Calculate overlapping bursts for input scenes
4. Mosaic swaths and bursts together

*InSAR Processing*
5. Prepare initial look-up table and simulated unwrapped image
    - Derive lookup table for SLC/MLI co-registration (considering terrain heights)
    - Simulate unwrapped interferometric phase using DEM height, and deformation rate using orbit state vectors
6. Interferogram creation, matching, refinement
    - Initial co-registration with look-up table
    - Iterative co-registration with look-up table
    - Removal of curved earth and topographic phase
7. Determine a co-registration offset based on the burst overlap (spectral diversity method)
    - Single iteration co-registration with look-up table
8. Phase unwrapping and coherence map generation
9. Generation of displacement maps from unwrapped differential phase

*Post-Processing*
10. Generation of geocoded GeoTIFF outputs

For a detailed description of InSAR processing using GAMMA software, refer to the readme file included with the product package.
