{% block dataLineageStatement %}
The line of sight displacement map is generated by scaling the unwrapped phase values (step 9) using GAMMA's dispmap program.

The basic steps in InSAR processing are as follows:

*Pre-Processing*
1. Ingest SLC data into GAMMA format
2. Get DEM file covering the area, apply geoid correction and resample/reproject as required
3. Calculate overlapping bursts for input scenes
4. Mosaic swaths and bursts together

*InSAR Processing*
5. Prepare initial look-up table and simulated unwrapped image
    - Derive lookup table for SLC/MLI co-registration (considering terrain heights)
    - Simulate unwrapped interferometric phase using DEM height, and deformation rate using orbit state vectors
6. Interferogram creation, matching, refinement
    - Initial co-registration with look-up table
    - Iterative co-registration with look-up table
    - Removal of curved earth and topographic phase
7. Determine a co-registration offset based on the burst overlap (spectral diversity method)
    - Single iteration co-registration with look-up table
8. Phase unwrapping and coherence map generation
9. Generation of displacement maps from unwrapped differential phase

*Post-Processing*
10. Generation of geocoded GeoTIFF outputs

For a detailed description of InSAR processing using GAMMA software, refer to the readme file included with the product package.

The LOS displacement map converts the unwrapped differential phase into measurements of ground movement in meters along the look vector (line-of-sight). Positive values indicate movement towards the sensor (such as uplift or lateral motion towards the sensor), while negative values indicate movement away from the sensor (such as subsidence or lateral motion away from the sensor). Note that deformation often includes both vertical and horizontal components, and additional processing or external reference data would be required to reliably calculate the relative contributions of vertical and lateral movement from the line-of-sight measurements.

Note that the values of the displacement maps are presented from the opposite perspective of the phase difference in the unwrapped interferogram. While movement towards the sensor will have negative values in the unwrapped interferogram, this direction of movement will be translated into positive values in the displacement maps. The signal path becomes shorter in the case of uplift, as the surface is closer to the sensor than previously (negative change in phase), but negative values for uplift would be counterintuitive in a displacement map, which is describing the movement relative to the surface of the earth rather than relative to the sensor location.
