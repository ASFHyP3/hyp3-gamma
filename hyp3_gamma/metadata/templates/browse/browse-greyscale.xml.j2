        <idPurp>This is a browse image of a Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) granule of {{ granule_type }} SAR data from the Sentinel-1 mission, processed using GAMMA software. The values are scaled from primary polarization values to improve the appearance of the image. To access actual {{ scale }} values, refer to the VV/VH/HV/HH TIFF files included in the same folder as this image. This image is resampled from the source GeoTIFF to be 2048 pixels wide.</idPurp>

        <idAbs>&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This file is a browse image of a Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) granule of {{ granule_description }} ({{ granule_type }}) Synthetic Aperture Radar data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission (European Space Agency). It is provided in {{ projection }} coordinates.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The actual RTC data in {{ scale }} scale (processed using the {{ dem_name }} Digital Elevation Model) is contained in the VV/HH (primary polarization) and/or VH/HV (cross-polarization) TIFF files included in the same downloaded folder as this file. This image is a rendering of the primary polarization data, scaled to an ASF standard to display nicely in greyscale for visualization purposes. The pixel spacing is resampled so that the output image is 2048 pixels wide.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The name of the SAR granule used to generate the files in this folder is: {{ granule_name }}.

The satellites use the same orbit pattern, but are offset by 180 degrees, allowing for repeat passes every 6 days. The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. The Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. Sentinel-1C was launched December 5, 2024 to take the place of Sentinel-1B in the constellation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Between the end of the mission for Sentinel-1B and the start of the Sentinel-1C mission, all acquisitions were made by Sentinel-1A. The acquisition plan was adjusted to provide as much coverage as possible with a single satellite, but some areas had little to no imagery acquired between December 2021 and April 2025.
