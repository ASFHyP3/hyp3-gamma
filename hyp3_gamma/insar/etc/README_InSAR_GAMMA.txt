----------------
Interferometric SAR (InSAR) uses the phase differences from repeat passes over the same area to identify regions where the distance between the sensor and the earth's surface has changed. This allows for the detection and quantification of deformation or movement.

Note that the imaging surface will vary depending on the sensor wavelength. Because Sentinel-1 is a C-band sensor, the waves will not penetrate very deeply into vegetation. The imagery likely represents the top of the canopy in densely vegetated areas rather than the actual terrain. In addition, vegetated areas tend to have low coherence, because plants can grow or move from one acquisition to the next. Use caution when generating interferograms for areas with extensive/dense vegetation cover.

A digital elevation model is required for processing InSAR. The DEM used for this particular product is the Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM, which has a native resolution of 1 arc second (about 30 meters). Scroll to the bottom of this file (after the description of InSAR Processing) to read more about the DEMs used by ASF.

----------------
## 1. Wrapped Interferogram

The wrapped interferogram is output in both a georeferenced PNG and KMZ format. Because the fringes are on a wrapped 2-pi scale rather than representing continuous values, a wrapped interferogram is most useful as a visualization. This product displays deformation in multiples of half of the sensor wavelength, so areas with fringes that are very close together indicate greater amounts of deformation in the line-of-sight direction from the sensor.

The wrapped interferogram image is generated from the interferogram phase prior to unwrapping.

The wrapped interferogram files are tagged with _color_phase, and PNG files are generated in two different resolutions. The file _color_phase.png is a small browse image (1024 pixels wide), and _color_phase_large.png is of higher resolution (2048 pixels wide). The KMZ file is 2048 pixels wide.

----------------
## 2. Unwrapped Interferogram

The unwrapped interferogram uses a reference point to convert the wrapped 2-pi scale into a continuous scale (of multiples of pi), and is the most important and complicated step in InSAR processing. It relies on having a reference point beyond the area of deformation, and is most effective when there are not any jumps greater than pi (a deformation greater than half the wavelength within the space of a single fringe). In regions of large-magnitude deformations or extremely steep topography, the fringes may be too close together to resolve, or one fringe may actually represent a jump of multiple phase wraps. Gamma software uses algorithms to detect phase inconsistencies and treat them appropriately, but some deformations may still be too large to generate reliable data.

The GeoTIFF contains the unwrapped values for each pixel, corresponding to the change in distance along the line of sight of the sensor. Positive values indicate movement away from the sensor (caused by subsidence or lateral movement away from the sensor) and negative values indicate movement towards the sensor (uplift or lateral movement towards the sensor). Note that deformation often includes both vertical and horizontal components, and additional processing or external reference data is required to calculate the relative contributions of vertical and lateral movement.

The unwrapped interferogram files are tagged with _unw_phase, and the _unw_phase.tif file contains the data values. PNG files are generated in two different resolutions; the file _unw_phase.png is a small browse image (1024 pixels wide), and _unw_phase_large.png is of higher resolution (2048 pixels wide). Also included is a KMZ file (2048 pixels wide).

----------------
## 3. Line-of-Sight Displacement Map

The LOS displacement map is in GeoTIFF format and converts the unwrapped differential phase into measurements of ground movement in meters along the look vector (line-of-sight). Positive values indicate movement towards the sensor (such as uplift), while negative values indicate movement away from the sensor (such as subsidence).

The LOS displacement map is tagged with _los_disp.tif

*Note that this file is optional. Select the "Include LOS Disp" option in the HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

----------------
## 4. Vertical Displacement Map

Gamma software generates a vertical displacement GeoTIFF from the unwrapped differential phase measurements under the assumption that the interferometric phase is related to topography only. The height map is transformed from the radar geometry (slant range/Doppler) using a DEM and resampled to the WGS84 ellipsoid to output an orthorectified product. Note that in cases where displacement occurs, the assumptions used to generate height may not be correct. Time series analysis or external data sources may be necessary to generate reliable displacement maps that take into consideration the relative influences of horizontal and vertical movement.

Values are in meters, with positive values indicating uplift and negative values indicating subsidence.

The vertical displacement map is tagged with _vert_disp.tif

----------------
## 5. Coherence Map

The spectra of the two images used for InSAR must overlap well enough to generate interferometric fringes. Areas without common overlap must be filtered out prior to InSAR generation. The correlation indicates the accuracy of the phase information, or the visibility of fringes. Areas with low correlation will have noisier phase. The magnitude of the correlation is commonly referred to as coherence. The coherence map is output as a GeoTIFF with values ranging from 0 to 1; the larger the number, the higher the coherence (and the better the correlation).

The coherence map is tagged with _corr.tif

----------------
## 6. Amplitude Image

The amplitude GeoTIFF indicates the calibrated radiometric backscatter from the reference granule in sigma-nought power. The image is terrain corrected using a geometric correction, but not radiometrically corrected. For more informative amplitude data, order Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products for your area of interest.

The amplitude image is tagged with _amp.tif

----------------
## 7. Parameter Documentation

The text file included with the product lists the key processing parameters used, including the full granule names, baseline length, number of looks, output resolution, and source DEM information. Note that the DEM is down-sampled to twice the pixel spacing of the desired InSAR output pixel spacing; an 80-m InSAR product requires the DEM to be down-sampled to a pixel spacing of 160 m.

The output product resolution depends on the number of looks in azimuth:
pixel spacing = 20 * azimuth looks

The text file is not tagged; it has a .txt extension on the base filename.

----------------
## 8. Look Vector Maps

Two look vector maps are output with the product as GeoTIFFs. The lv_theta map indicates the SAR look vector elevation angle at each map pixel, ranging from -pi/2 (down) to pi/2 (up). The lv_phi map indicates the SAR look vector orientation angle at each map pixel, ranging from 0 (east) to pi/2 (north).

*Note that these files are optional. Select the "Angle Maps" option in the HyP3 Processing Options to include them in the product package.*

----------------
## 9. Incidence Angle Map

The local incidence angle is defined as the angle between the incident radar signal and the local surface normal.  Output is a GeoTIFF giving the local incidence angle in radians for each pixel in the scene.

*Note that this file is optional. Select the "Include Inc. Angle Map" option in the HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

----------------
## 10. Water Mask

The water mask specifies, pixel-by-pixel, where there is land and where there is water in the corresponding InSAR product.  In the mask, 1 is land and 0 denotes water.  This mask is applied to the DEM prior to running InSAR jobs, effectively clipping out the water as water is set to a no data value at the start of processing.  The water mask is stored as a byte-valued GeoTIFF file.

*Note that this file is optional. Select the "Include Water Mask" option in the HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

-------------
## 11. Digital Elevation Model

The digital elevation file contains the terrain height for the scenes being processed. The values are taken from the Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM.

*Note that this file is optional. Select the "Include DEM" option in the HyP3 Processing Options to include it in the product package.*

# DEMs #

ASF uses publicly-available Digital Elevation Models for processing SAR data.

The Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM is a global Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from the WorldDEM. The WorldDEM is based on radar satellite data acquired by the TanDEM-X mission, which was funded by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Airbus Defence and Space, and edited to flatten water bodies, provide consistent flow of rivers, and apply corrections to shore/coastlines and special features. For an overview of the dataset, visit https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/fr/dataset-details?articleId=394198. The product handbook is available at https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/documents/20126/0/GEO1988-CopernicusDEM-SPE-002_ProductHandbook_I1.00.pdf.

# The Sentinel-1 mission #

The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation is part of the Copernicus Earth Observation program, coordinated by the European Space Agency (ESA) on behalf of the European Commission (EC). Sentinel-1 satellites carry C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments for global, around-the-clock imagery, even through cloud cover. The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and the Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle, but are offset 180 degrees in order to repeat passes every 6 days.
